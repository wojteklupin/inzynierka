vertical spacing: 50%
horizontal spacing: 50%
split with one activity in each branch: symmetrical

split with unequal amount of activities in branches:
    longer branch on bottom (even better pulled down)

interleaving: don't keep branching height consistent with others - minimize it

message flows: don't bend if possible
               if not don't bend leftmost flows
               bend only between pools
               
boundary events: better at bottom boundary (wedlug pdfa) (conclusion should be - don't place events at multiple boundaries) - do glebszego zastanowienia
